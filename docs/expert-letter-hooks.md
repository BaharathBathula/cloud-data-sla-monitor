# Expert Letter Reference

The following points are intended to guide independent experts reviewing the Unified Data Quality & SLA Monitoring Framework for Cloud Data Pipelines.

Experts may reference these observations based on their independent assessment of the framework.

## Originality Assessment
- The framework introduces a unified approach that combines data quality validation and explicit SLA enforcement.
- It addresses a gap in existing data engineering practices where reliability standards are often implicit or inconsistently applied.
- The architecture reflects an original integration of validation, monitoring, and reporting components.

## Significance to the Field
- Data reliability is a recognized challenge in modern analytics and data-driven decision-making.
- By treating data SLAs as first-class constraints, the framework advances how organizations operationalize data trust.
- The contribution provides a reusable reference model applicable across industries and data platforms.

## Broader Impact
- The framework can be adopted or extended by engineering teams to improve data reliability practices.
- It contributes to the broader data engineering community by offering an open, extensible approach to reliability enforcement.
- The contribution extends beyond a single employer and benefits the field at large.
