# cloud-data-sla-monitor

## Overview
This repository presents an original, unified framework for monitoring data quality and enforcing data SLAs across modern cloud-based data pipelines.

## Problem Statement
Modern data pipelines suffer from silent data failures, SLA breaches, and unreliable downstream analytics. Existing tools typically focus on either data quality checks or pipeline monitoring, but rarely provide a unified, automated framework that enforces data SLAs, detects quality degradation, and alerts stakeholders in real time. This gap leads to data incidents, delayed decisions, and significant business risk in data-driven organizations.

## Why This Is Original
- Combines data quality validation and SLA enforcement into a single automated system
- Provides a reusable, cloud-agnostic architecture
- Addresses a critical gap in modern data engineering workflows

## Key Features
- Automated data quality checks
- SLA breach detection
- Alerting and observability integration
- Modular, extensible design
